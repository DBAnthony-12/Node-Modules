# Node-Modules
Node modules refer to reusable blocks that encapsulate functionality and can be easily integrated into node.js applications. Since node.js follows the CommonJS module system, developers can define modules using module syntax which uses the exports objects and uses the require() function to import them. Built in modules include functionalities like file system operations(‘fs’), HTTP server handling(‘http’) and both manipulation(‘path’). External modules are developed by the community and cover a wide range of functionalities such as web frameworks, database connectors, utility libraries and more.
